## Features
- **Start**: Begins timing from zero (or the last recorded time). The stopwatch starts counting continuously until paused or stopped.
- **Stop**: Stops the stopwatch, halting the time measurement at the moment the button is pressed.
- **Reset**: Clears the current time and resets the stopwatch back to zero, ready for a new session.
- **Pause**: Temporarily halts the stopwatch without resetting it, allowing you to resume from where you left off.
